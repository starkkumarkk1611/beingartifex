Migrate, Clone or Move your WordPress site to 5000+ web hosts with Migrate Guru. Proud Migration Partners for WP Engine, Pantheon, FlyWheel, etc.

== DESCRIPTION ==

Migrate Guru is the fastest way to migrate WordPress sites. It simplifies difficult WordPress migrations (e.g. multi-site networks, 200 GB sites, etc.).

Powered by BlogVault (an onboarding partner of top WordPress hosts in the world), Migrate Guru uses intelligent processes on its own servers… So there is ZERO risk to your sites. It automatically rewrites URLs, bypasses import-export scripts, and handles serialised data. It also can clone WordPress sites without any manual work, add-ons, or additional tools.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

=What do I need to use MG?=
You’ll need:
* An account on the new web hosting service
* A domain on the new host, with WordPress installed
* The destination’s FTP/cPanel details

=How long does MG take to move a site?=
MG can move a 1 GB (files & database) site in <30 Mins*
(*Approximate & depends on a number of factors).

=Are there any limitations on the number of migrations?=
Yes. We’ve enforced a limit of 5 site migrations/user/month (developers can request to have this limit extended). This cap ensures that our servers aren’t overburdened. Each of the 5 sites can be moved unlimited times.

=Does MG backup my site?=
No.

=Do I need to have WordPress installed in the destination?=
Yes.

=Do I need to have MG installed in the destination to transfer my site?=
No. It’s only needed on the source site.

=Why do you need FTP/cPanel details?=
MG needs these details since FTP/cPanel is the safest way to move your site.

=How do I move a multi-site network?=
When installed on a WordPress multi-site network, the plugin automatically becomes ‘network activated’. Once this is done you can go by the same steps as a single site.

=Do you have a help guide/documentation?=
Yes, we do. You can access it here: https://migrateguru.freshdesk.com/support/home
